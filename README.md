# checkout_OffersApp
 The Discount Offers Selection is a basic project that allows users to choose from a variety of discount offers. These offers are stored in the Django admin database and can be dynamically displayed to the users. Users can select the offers they want to avail by checking the corresponding checkboxes. The selected offers are then stored in the database for further processing.
